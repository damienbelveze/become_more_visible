this is a toot posted in Mastodon by a researcher asking where she should publish her paper on analysis of Twitter data to explore the science reform community structure.
This is a good introduction to our session because it is a genuine problem of publication strategy

we will talk about rejection rates later, when we will say some words about predatory open access publishers

About bibliodiversity : I asked this person to what extend she thought that it could be damageable for her reputation as scientist to publish most of her papers in the same journal ; she answered that she had not really idea about this and that maybe it was not a problem at all ; this is an open question : what do you think about it?

"nepotistic or self promotion journals"

- increase transparency
- get feedback from the design of the study
- reduce data or hypothesis manipulation risks (**harking**)
:::
:::
::::
:::{.notes}

basically, study registration aims at limiting Harking (Hypothesis after Results Are Known). Harking is a scientific misconduct.

Side effects aren't known well. There are concerns regarding (in)flexibility, selection of topics easier to preregister, a leftover risk of cheating preregs, increases in costs and effort.

:::
::::
:::{.notes}
preprint deposits have become commonplace in the field of scientific publishing and in most of the cases, but not all (some disciplines are still reluctant such as chemistry), publishers have finally accepted that preprints are deposited by the researcher ahead of the publication. 

Sometimes funders require that a preprint should be deposited (see for instance Gates and Melinda Fundation) ; when the publisher refuses, it happens that researchers deposit their preprint after the publication is made, which is a bit tricky, but researchers have to deal with several constraints, sometimes contradictory ones.

:::
:::
::::
:::{.notes}
APC cost rises three times more than inflation (triples between 2013 and 2022 according to Blanchard : 

the total cost of APCs has tripled in the period 2013-2020. The major driver is the growth of articles in Gold OA journals, i.e. fully open access journals with APCs (without this growth, the APC cost would have been multiplied by 1,69 instead of 3)

APC model lowers barriers to readers only to raise them for authors.
(same things for publish and read models : some institutions can afford it, some not). 

**Business models based on APCs and subscriptions are highly inequitable.**

APC model removes barriers to readers but raise new barriers to authors, excluding scientists from underfundend institutions to equally contribute to scientific cooperation

# Diamond OA {background-color="#fef1da"}

![](images/seismica.png)

:::{.notes}
Diamond Road was forged as a concept by Marie Farge, french mathematician and physicist in 2012 to restore inclusivity in the scientific communication system and lower barriers as well to readings than to publications. 
Diamond road is about making possible to publish peer reviewed articles for free thanks to non-for-profit publishing institutions. 
According to the definition of Fuchs and Sandoval (2013) : 
"In the Diamond Open Access Model, not-for-profit, non-commercial organisations, associations or networks publish material that is made available online in digital format, is free of charge for readers and authors and does not allow commercial and for-profit re-use."
community-controlled 
no copyright transfer
OA
no APC 
proportionate and transparent cost structure
:::

# {background-color="#fef1da"}

- some SHS journals do not want to give up the subscription model but they do not think in full-costs terms

- some OA pure players are very fragile. When they shut down, we loose hundreds of papers going offline

## {background-color="#fef1da"}


**Everything (dataset, code, preprint, protocol) may be linked to the open access copy deposited on HAL**

![](images/HAL_links.png)

## Store your dataset in a trusted repository {background-color="#fef1da" .incremental}

- hosted in Europe
- attributes PID to datasets
- has a policy aligned with OpenScience
- is non for profit (avoid FigShare)
- is curated (recommended)

[Re3data.org](https://re3data.org) directory

:::{.notes}

- Is the repository future-proof? : the chosen repository should have been online for at least 5 years.

- Does the repository's policy restricts the choice of licences that can assigned to your data? : if you cannot share your data under the licence 
you have chosen, you would better find a better offer elsewhere.

- Are deposits curated by someone? Without a proper curation, your may neglect important metadata in your dataset's description which could have a negative impact on its findability and reusability.

- Do the repository deliver persistent identifiers to datasets (DOI for instance)? : These identifiers are necessary to make your data findable

- Do you have to pay to deposit your data? Some fees are abusive, particularly in the for-profit sector, where some big companies charge costs that bear no relation to the service provided

- Is the repository located in Europe? GDPR compliance is at stake

Should we build decentralized infrastructures to store our data out of Fascists' hands ?

<img src="images/censorship_data.png" alt="a hand is blurring sequences of binaire digits">

:::{.notes}
In order to purge them from a list of 17 "forbidden words among which LGBT, non binary, transgender and climate change", several federal repositories were forced to cut access to their databases. Employees sometimes managed to back-up copies of theses databases on Internet Archive servers. In order to prevent an authoritarian regime to alter research data should the scientific community build a decentralized and distributed infrastructure to store their data?
:::

## what about source code {background-color="#fef1da"}

:::{.incremental}
- source code replicability is a component of study reproducibility
- You have to build replicable code (as much as possible) and give access to your source code from a forge AND the Software Heritage archive
- Dont't forget to put an open licence to your code so that other may reuse it for their own experiments
- **everything should be linked by PID to ensure Findability : your grant, your publication, your data, your code... and yourself**

Why should you have an ORCID?
:::
::::{.r-fit-text}
:::{.incremental}
- international standard
- get credited for all the works you have published
- pivot identifier with commercial (WOSID, ScopusID) or institutional identifiers (idHAL, idref)
- for administration, make easier to link grants, publications, source code, datasets to a single researcher
- higher adoption rate in STEM than in SHS

you, only, are entitled to create your own ORCID and populate it with your works. Don't make it twice! record your identifier and password in your password manager

**other things you may consider to do in order to be more visible**

:::{.incremental}
- managing you Googler Scholar profile
- creating accounts on social networks (Mastodon or Bluesky)
- creating a static website to share your thoughts and showcase the diversity of your works
:::

# {background-color="#fef1da"}

**Why should you use Mastodon to communicate with other researchers?**

- Mastodon is non-for-profit (no risk of *enshittification*)
- Fediverse network is fully decentralized (Bluesky is only partialy decentralized)
- Fediverse is transparent (no hidden algorithm)
- policies are applied locally on each instance

# personal website

> In essence, the researcher is dispersed: conferences, journal articles, book chapters, blog posts, courses, project management, scientific or editorial committees, etc. It's a job that involves a wide variety of written and oral productions. It's a profession that involves a wide variety of written and oral productions. If only to unify all this, to guarantee an exhaustive point of access, it would be useful to have a portal linking all the digital or analog places of knowledge where we work.
