# editorial bias and nepotistic reviews

"nepotistic or self promotion journals"

- when the most prolific authors are also part of the editorial board
- when you have kins or team mates in the editorial board

## why study registration

:::{.incremental}
- increase transparency
- get feedback from the design of the study
- reduce data or hypothesis manipulation risks
:::
:::{.notes}
Side effects aren't known well. There are concerns regarding (in)flexibility, selection of topics easier to preregister, a leftover risk of cheating preregs, increases in costs and effort.

You have just finished the [manuscript](title_abstract.html) of your paper. To which journals will you submit it ?

- you do not have money to pay Article Processes Charges

- your paper should be accessible to all without embargo once published

## {background-color="#fef1da"}

**should you deposit a preprint version of your work** ?

## {background-color="#fef1da"}

**should you deposit a preprint version of your work ?**

- is it possible to have a paper published in the *Bone & Joint Journal* after having deposited it on BioRXiv?

- is it possible to have a paper published in the ACM *Journal on Experimental Algorithmics* after having deposited it on SSRN (owned by Elsevier)?

- is it possible to have a paper published in the journal *Physical Review Fluids* after having deposited in an institutionnal preprint server?

## Plan S : make scientific output immediately available {background-color="#fef1da"}

- green open access with retention right strategy
- gold open access
- diamond open access

## Green Open Access {background-color="#fef1da"}

- [HAL](https://hal.sciences)
- [Sherpa Romeo](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/)
- *Loi pour une République Numérique*, 2016

# traditional way of publishing

- inflation of subscription costs
- 2012, Tim Gowers : "The cost of knowledge"
- embargo periods

# Gold Open Access {background-color="#fef1da"}

- immediately open access
- Gold should be more than "APC"
- hybrid Open Access

# Is it possible to publish your paper in these journals


# The three pillars of Open Science
