# editorial bias and nepotistic reviews

"nepotistic or self promotion journals"

- when the most prolific authors are also part of the editorial board
- when you have kins or team mates in the editorial board

:::{.incremental}
- increase transparency
- get feedback from the design of the study
- reduce data or hypothesis manipulation risks (**harking**)
:::

::::
:::{.notes}

basically, study registration aims at limiting Harking (Hypothesis after Results Are Known). Harking is a scientific misconduct.

Side effects aren't known well. There are concerns regarding (in)flexibility, selection of topics easier to preregister, a leftover risk of cheating preregs, increases in costs and effort.

- you do not have money to pay Article Processes Charges

- your paper should be accessible to all without embargo once published

:::
:::
::::
:::{.notes}
APC cost rises three times more than inflation (triples between 2013 and 2022 according to Blanchard : 

the total cost of APCs has tripled in the period 2013-2020. The major driver is the growth of articles in Gold OA journals, i.e. fully open access journals with APCs (without this growth, the APC cost would have been multiplied by 1,69 instead of 3)

APC model lowers barriers to readers only to raise them for authors.
(same things for publish and read models : some institutions can afford it, some not). 

**Business models based on APCs and subscriptions are highly inequitable.**

- Publications
- Data management

Why should you have an ORCID?
:::
::::{.r-fit-text}
:::{.incremental}
- international standard
- get credited for all the works you have published
- pivot identifier with commercial (WOSID, ScopusID) or institutional identifiers (idHAL, idref)
- for administration, make easier to link grants, publications, source code, datasets to a single researcher
- higher adoption rate in STEM than in SHS
:::
::::
:::{.notes}
you only can create your own ORCID and populate it with your works.

**other things you may consider to do in order to be more visible**

- creating accounts on social networks (Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky ?)
- creating a static website to share your thoughts and showcase the diversity of your works
