# Title  

Cracking the Code: An Analysis of Motivations Among Participants in the Cicada 3301 Enigma

# Abstract 

The Cicada 3301 enigma is a notorious internet-based puzzle that has attracted a large following
since its inception in 2012. While many have attempted to solve the enigma, little is known about the
motivations of those who participate. In this study, we surveyed individuals who had attempted to solve
the Cicada 3301 enigma and analyzed their demographics and motivations for participation. Our results
showed that participants were predominantly male (85%), with a high proportion working in the field of
informatics (58%). The majority of participants played at night (76%), with many playing during work hours
(56%). When asked about their motivations, respondents reported a range of reasons for participating. The
most common motivation was the desire to be part of a community of players (46%), followed by the belief
that solving the enigma could lead to recruitment in an intelligence office (34%). A smaller but still
significant proportion of participants (15%) were motivated by the opportunity to gain ideas for creating
their own augmented reality games. Our findings shed light on the motivations and demographics of
individuals who participate in complex puzzles like Cicada 3301, offering insights into the allure and appeal
of these types of challenges.
